--- 
A key-value database utilizing JSON dot-notation for queries. 

## Installation
```bash
~$: npm i aerialdb
```


## Why aerialdb?
I set out to make aerialdb a quick and relatively easy for people with varying skils of expertise to pick up, [similar to the folks at quick.db](https://github.com/plexidev/quick.db) (hence, the similar naming scheme). Think of aerialdb as a more slimmed down version of quick.db with no wrappers and is less demanding on disk space, coming in around `26.5Mbs` in size with all dependancies.

I intend on making aerialdb even less demanding on disk space, faster, and porting it to other platforms seperate to JS.
